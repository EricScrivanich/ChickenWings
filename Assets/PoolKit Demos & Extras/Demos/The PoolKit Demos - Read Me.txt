POOLKIT DEMOS

The PoolKit Demos use some standard assets and cannot be included by default due to rules in the Asset Store. These guidelines are intended to maximize compatibility between Unity versions. To download these demos manually, you can download and install the package located here:

As always, don't forget to backup your project first! :)
